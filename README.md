# Counter App

This is a simple Counter app built using Flutter to demonstrate state management techniques with Provider, ChangeNotifier, and NotifierListener.

The app is structured using the MVP (Model-View-Provider) architecture, making the code more modular, scalable, and easy to maintain.

## Features
Increment and decrement the counter value.

Uses Provider for state management, ensuring a clean separation of business logic from the UI.

Implements ChangeNotifier and NotifierListener to update and listen to changes in the app state.

Follows the MVP architecture pattern to maintain a clean code structure.

## Folder Structure
The app follows the MVP pattern, arranged into three primary folders:

### Model: 
Contains the data classes and business logic.
### View:
 Contains the UI components such as screens and widgets.
### Provider: 
Contains the state management classes using ChangeNotifier to handle app state.

### Dependencies
provider: ^6.0.0
